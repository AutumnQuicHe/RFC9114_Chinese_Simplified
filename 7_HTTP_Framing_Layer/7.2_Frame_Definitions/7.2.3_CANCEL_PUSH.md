The CANCEL_PUSH frame (type=0x03) is used to request cancellation of a server push prior to the push stream being received. The CANCEL_PUSH frame identifies a server push by push ID (see Section 4.6), encoded as a variable-length integer.

**取消推送帧**（类型值为`0x03`）的用途是在推送流被接收到前要求取消服务器推送。**取消推送帧**使用推送ID（详见[第4.6章]()）来代表某服务器推送，它被编码为一个可变长度整型。

When a client sends a CANCEL_PUSH frame, it is indicating that it does not wish to receive the promised resource. The server SHOULD abort sending the resource, but the mechanism to do so depends on the state of the corresponding push stream. If the server has not yet created a push stream, it does not create one. If the push stream is open, the server SHOULD abruptly terminate that stream. If the push stream has already ended, the server MAY still abruptly terminate the stream or MAY take no action.

当客户端发送**取消推送帧**时，它是在表明它不希望接收到被承诺的资源。这时服务器**应该**中止发送资源，但是该中止机制能否起效取决于相关推送流的状态。如果服务器尚未创建推送流，那么它就不会创建。如果推送流已经打开，那么服务器**应该**中止该流。如果推送流已经关闭，那么服务器**可以**中止该流，也**可以**什么都不做。

A server sends a CANCEL_PUSH frame to indicate that it will not be fulfilling a promise that was previously sent. The client cannot expect the corresponding promise to be fulfilled, unless it has already received and processed the promised response. Regardless of whether a push stream has been opened, a server SHOULD send a CANCEL_PUSH frame when it determines that promise will not be fulfilled. If a stream has already been opened, the server can abort sending on the stream with an error code of H3_REQUEST_CANCELLED.

当服务器发送**取消推送帧**时，它是在表明它将不会兑现某个曾经发送的承诺。客户端无法再期待相关承诺得到兑现，除非它已经接收到且处理了这项被承诺的资源。无论推送流是否已被打开，服务器都**应该**在决定不再兑现承诺时发送**取消推送帧**。如果已经打开了推送流，那么服务器可以用错误码`H3_REQUEST_CANCELLED`（请求被取消）来中止在流上的发送。

Sending a CANCEL_PUSH frame has no direct effect on the state of existing push streams. A client SHOULD NOT send a CANCEL_PUSH frame when it has already received a corresponding push stream. A push stream could arrive after a client has sent a CANCEL_PUSH frame, because a server might not have processed the CANCEL_PUSH. The client SHOULD abort reading the stream with an error code of H3_REQUEST_CANCELLED.

**取消推送帧**的请求对现存推送流的状态没有直接影响。客户端**不应该**在已经接收到相关推送流的情况下任然发送**取消推送帧**。在客户端发出**取消推送帧**后依然有可能接收到推送流，因为服务器可能没有处理到这个**取消推送帧**。客户端**应该**使用错误码`H3_REQUEST_CANCELLED`来中止在流上的读取。

A CANCEL_PUSH frame is sent on the control stream. Receiving a CANCEL_PUSH frame on a stream other than the control stream MUST be treated as a connection error of type H3_FRAME_UNEXPECTED.

**取消推送流**是在控制流上发送的。如果在并非控制流的某条流上接收到了**取消推送流**，那么**必须**将该情况视作类型为`H3_FRAME_UNEXPECTED`的连接错误。

The CANCEL_PUSH frame carries a push ID encoded as a variable-length integer. The Push ID field identifies the server push that is being cancelled; see Section 4.6. If a CANCEL_PUSH frame is received that references a push ID greater than currently allowed on the connection, this MUST be treated as a connection error of type H3_ID_ERROR.

**取消推送帧**携带着一个经过可变长度整形编码的推送ID。推送ID字段标识了将要取消的服务器推送，详见[第4.6章]()。如果接收到的**取消推送帧**中使用的推送ID大于当前连接上所允许的最大推送ID，那么**必须**将该情况视作类型为`H3_ID_ERROR`（ID错误）的连接错误。

If the client receives a CANCEL_PUSH frame, that frame might identify a push ID that has not yet been mentioned by a PUSH_PROMISE frame due to reordering. If a server receives a CANCEL_PUSH frame for a push ID that has not yet been mentioned by a PUSH_PROMISE frame, this MUST be treated as a connection error of type H3_ID_ERROR.

由于数据包乱序的存在，客户端接收到的**取消推送帧**可能使用了一个尚未被**推送承诺帧**提供过的推送ID。如果服务器接收到的**取消推送帧**使用了一个尚未用**推送承诺帧**提供过的推送ID，那么**必须**将该情况视作类型为`H3_ID_ERROR`的连接错误。
