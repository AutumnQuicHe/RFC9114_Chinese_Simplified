The security considerations of HTTP/3 should be comparable to those of HTTP/2 with TLS. However, many of the considerations from Section 10 of [HTTP/2] apply to [QUIC-TRANSPORT] and are discussed in that document.

HTTP/3的安全性应该与使用了TLS的HTTP/2的安全性相当。
然而，《[HTTP/2]()》的[第10章]()中的许多考量都适用于《[QUIC传输]()》，本文档对此进行了讨论。
