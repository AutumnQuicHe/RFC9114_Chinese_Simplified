Several characteristics of HTTP/3 provide an observer an opportunity to correlate actions of a single client or server over time. These include the value of settings, the timing of reactions to stimulus, and the handling of any features that are controlled by settings.

HTTP/3的一些特征使得观察者有机会将单个客户端或服务器在不同时期的活动互相关联起来。这些活动包括设置的值、对刺激作出反应的时间和对由设置控制的特性的处理方式。

As far as these create observable differences in behavior, they could be used as a basis for fingerprinting a specific client.

只要这些活动表现出行为上的差异，就可以将它们作为追踪某个特定客户端的基准。

HTTP/3's preference for using a single QUIC connection allows correlation of a user's activity on a site. Reusing connections for different origins allows for correlation of activity across those origins.

HTTP/3使用单条QUIC连接的倾向使得某用户在某网站上的活动能够被关联起来。为不同的源复用同一条连接使得这些源间的活动能够被关联起来。

Several features of QUIC solicit immediate responses and can be used by an endpoint to measure latency to their peer; this might have privacy implications in certain scenarios.

QUIC中一些会引发即时响应的特性会被终端用来测量与对端间的延迟；这在特定场景下可能会对隐私产生影响。
