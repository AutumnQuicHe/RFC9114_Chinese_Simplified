HTTP semantics ([HTTP]) are used for a broad range of services on the Internet. These semantics have most commonly been used with HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. HTTP/1.1 has been used over a variety of transport and session layers, while HTTP/2 has been used primarily with TLS over TCP. HTTP/3 supports the same semantics over a new transport protocol: QUIC.

HTTP语义（详见《[HTTP]()》）被广泛用于互联网上的各种服务。
其中最常见的是将这些语义与HTTP/1.1或HTTP/2协议一起使用。
HTTP/1.1的用途是基于各种传输层和会话层的，而HTTP/2主要与基于TCP的TLS一起使用。
HTTP/3同样支持HTTP语义，但是它的根基是一种全新的传输协议：QUIC。
