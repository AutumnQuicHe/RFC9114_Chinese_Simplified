Although HTTP is independent of the transport protocol, the "http" scheme associates authority with the ability to receive TCP connections on the indicated port of whatever host is identified within the authority component. Because HTTP/3 does not use TCP, HTTP/3 cannot be used for direct access to the authoritative server for a resource identified by an "http" URI. However, protocol extensions such as [ALTSVC] permit the authoritative server to identify other services that are also authoritative and that might be reachable over HTTP/3.

尽管HTTP并不依赖具体的传输协议，但是“http”协议将权威性与是否具有在由URI的授权机构部分标识的任意主机的指定端口上接受TCP连接的能力关联在一起。因为HTTP/3并不使用TCP，所以HTTP/3不能被用于为了某由“http”URI标识的资源而直接访问权威服务器的情况。然而，《[ALTSVC]()》等协议扩展允许权威服务器标识另一些同样具有权威性的，且可以通过HTTP/3来访问的服务。

Prior to making requests for an origin whose scheme is not "https", the client MUST ensure the server is willing to serve that scheme. For origins whose scheme is "http", an experimental method to accomplish this is described in [RFC8164]. Other mechanisms might be defined for various schemes in the future.

在向着协议部分并非“https”的源发送请求前，客户端**必须**确保服务器愿意以那种协议来提供服务。对于协议部分是“http”的源，《[RFC8164]()》提供了一种实验性的方法来判断。在将来，其他机制可能会因为各种协议而被制定出来。
