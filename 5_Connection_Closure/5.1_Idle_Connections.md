Each QUIC endpoint declares an idle timeout during the handshake. If the QUIC connection remains idle (no packets received) for longer than this duration, the peer will assume that the connection has been closed. HTTP/3 implementations will need to open a new HTTP/3 connection for new requests if the existing connection has been idle for longer than the idle timeout negotiated during the QUIC handshake, and they SHOULD do so if approaching the idle timeout; see Section 10.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

每个QUIC终端都在握手过程中声明了空闲超时的时长。
如果某QUIC连接保持空闲（没有接收到数据包）的时长超过了此值，那么对端将认为该连接已经被关闭。
如果现存的连接已经保持空闲状态的时长超过了在QUIC握手期间协商的空闲超时值，那么HTTP/3实现就要为新请求打开新的HTTP/3连接，并且在空闲时长临近该上限时也**应该**这么做；详见《[QUIC传输]()》的[第10.1章]()。

HTTP clients are expected to request that the transport keep connections open while there are responses outstanding for requests or server pushes, as described in Section 10.1.2 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]. If the client is not expecting a response from the server, allowing an idle connection to time out is preferred over expending effort maintaining a connection that might not be needed. A gateway MAY maintain connections in anticipation of need rather than incur the latency cost of connection establishment to servers. Servers SHOULD NOT actively keep connections open.

HTTP客户端应该在仍有未收到的响应或服务器推送时请求传输层将连接保持开放状态，详见《[QUIC传输]()》的[第10.1.2章]()。
如果客户端并没有在等待来自服务器的响应，那么比起花费资源维持一条可能再也用不上的连接，更应该允许空闲的连接因超时而关闭。
而网关则**可以**维持此连接，以防万一，而不是在将来重新建立连接时为服务器增添延迟上的负担。
服务器**不应该**积极地维持开放的连接。
