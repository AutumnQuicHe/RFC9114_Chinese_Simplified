For various reasons, the QUIC transport could indicate to the application layer that the connection has terminated. This might be due to an explicit closure by the peer, a transport-level error, or a change in network topology that interrupts connectivity.

出于各种原因，QUIC传输可以向应用层告知连接已经被关闭的消息。
这种情况可能是因为对端主动发起了关闭、某个传输层的错误或者网络拓扑上的变化打断了可连接性。

If a connection terminates without a GOAWAY frame, clients MUST assume that any request that was sent, whether in whole or in part, might have been processed.

如果一条连接在没有发送**关闭帧**的情况下就终止了，那么客户端**必须**认为所有已经发送出去的请求，无论是已经完整地发送了还是只发送了一部分，都有可能得到了处理。
