All client-initiated bidirectional streams are used for HTTP requests and responses. A bidirectional stream ensures that the response can be readily correlated with the request. These streams are referred to as request streams.

所有由客户端发起的双向流都是用于HTTP请求和响应的。双向流确保了响应能够被方便地关联到请求上。这类流被称作请求流。

This means that the client's first request occurs on QUIC stream 0, with subsequent requests on streams 4, 8, and so on. In order to permit these streams to open, an HTTP/3 server SHOULD configure non-zero minimum values for the number of permitted streams and the initial stream flow-control window. So as to not unnecessarily limit parallelism, at least 100 request streams SHOULD be permitted at a time.

这种约定意味着客户端的首个请求会出现在序号为`0`的QUIC流上，后续请求则出现在序号`4`、序号`8`，以此类推。为了打开这些流，HTTP/3服务器**应该**将允许创建的流数量下限以及初始流量控制窗口大小设置为非零值。为了不阻碍并行的请求，**应该**允许同一时间存在至少100条请求流。

HTTP/3 does not use server-initiated bidirectional streams, though an extension could define a use for these streams. Clients MUST treat receipt of a server-initiated bidirectional stream as a connection error of type H3_STREAM_CREATION_ERROR unless such an extension has been negotiated.

HTTP/3没有使用由服务器发起的双向流，不过扩展可以为这类流定义一种用途。除非协商使用了这样的扩展，否则如果客户端接收到了一条由服务器发起的双向流，那么**必须**将该情况视作类型为`H3_STREAM_CREATION_ERROR`（流创建错误）的连接错误。
