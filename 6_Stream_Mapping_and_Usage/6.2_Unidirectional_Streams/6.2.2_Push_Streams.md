Server push is an optional feature introduced in HTTP/2 that allows a server to initiate a response before a request has been made. See Section 4.6 for more details.

服务器推送是由HTTP/2引入的一种可选功能，它允许服务器在请求发出前就发起响应，详见[第4.6章]()。

A push stream is indicated by a stream type of 0x01, followed by the push ID of the promise that it fulfills, encoded as a variable-length integer. The remaining data on this stream consists of HTTP/3 frames, as defined in Section 7.2, and fulfills a promised server push by zero or more interim HTTP responses followed by a single final HTTP response, as defined in Section 4.1. Server push and push IDs are described in Section 4.6.

推送流是用值为`0x01`的流类型来表示的，后方跟着它所兑现的推送ID，后者也被编码为一个可变长度整型。这条流的剩余数据由HTTP/3的帧组成，详见[第7.2章]()。这些剩余数据数据通过任意数量的（或不发送）临时HTTP响应加上一个最终的HTTP响应的形式兑现曾经承诺过的服务器推送，详见[第4.1章]()。[第4.6章]()描述了服务器推送和推送ID。

Only servers can push; if a server receives a client-initiated push stream, this MUST be treated as a connection error of type H3_STREAM_CREATION_ERROR.

只有服务器可以推送；如果服务器接收到了一条由客户端发起的推送流，那么**必须**将该情况视作类型为`H3_STREAM_CREATION_ERROR`的连接错误。

Push Stream Header {
Stream Type (i) = 0x01,
Push ID (i),
}

  推送ID (i),
}

A client SHOULD NOT abort reading on a push stream prior to reading the push stream header, as this could lead to disagreement between client and server on which push IDs have already been consumed.

客户端**不应该**在读取推送流的头部前就中止读取推送流，因为这会使得客户端和服务器就哪些推送ID得到了处理产生认知差异。

Each push ID MUST only be used once in a push stream header. If a client detects that a push stream header includes a push ID that was used in another push stream header, the client MUST treat this as a connection error of type H3_ID_ERROR.

每个推送ID都**必须**被一次性地用于推送流的头部。如果客户端检测到某条推送流的头部的推送ID已被用于另一条推送流的头部，那么**必须**将该情况视作类型为`H3_ID_ERROR`（ID错误）的连接错误。
